# General Problem Solving Template

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Read problem carefully, identify ALL given information
- Identify what is asked: find, prove, show, or evaluate
- List known quantities with units
- Note constraints or conditions (e.g., x > 0, integer solutions, domain restrictions)
- Identify the topic and sub-topic

## Step 2: Plan the Approach

### Method Selection Guide
- **Direct computation**: When a formula directly applies
- **Substitution**: When expression needs simplification
- **Case analysis**: When conditions depend on parameter values
- **Working backwards**: When answer choices are given (MCQ strategy)
- **Elimination**: When direct approach is too complex
- **Contradiction**: When proving impossibility
- **Complementary counting**: When counting "not X" is easier than "X"

## Step 3: Execute the Solution
- Apply formulas step-by-step, showing all intermediate work
- Maintain proper notation and structure
- Check signs carefully at every step
- Simplify expressions as you go

### Computation Best Practices
- Do NOT skip algebraic steps
- When squaring both sides, check for extraneous solutions
- When taking square root, consider both positive and negative values
- When dividing, ensure divisor is not zero
- When canceling terms, ensure the canceled term is non-zero
- Verify domain restrictions are maintained throughout

## Step 4: Verify the Answer
- Substitute answer back into original equation/condition
- Check if the answer satisfies all given constraints
- Verify the answer is reasonable (order of magnitude, sign, units)
- For MCQ: plug answer into original problem to confirm
- Cross-check using an alternative method if time permits

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Sign errors**: Track negative signs through every step
- **Domain violations**: Check that answer lies in the valid domain
- **Extraneous solutions**: Always verify when you square, take log, or use substitution
- **Missing solutions**: Check all cases (e.g., both roots of quadratic)
- **Unit errors**: Ensure consistent units (degrees vs radians)
- **Incomplete answers**: Answer exactly what was asked

## JEE-Specific Strategies
- **Time management**: Spend at most 3-4 minutes per problem initially
- **MCQ approach**: For single-answer MCQ, elimination can save time
- **Integer type**: Verify answer is a non-negative integer (0-9)
- **Multiple correct**: Check ALL options systematically
- **Paragraph-based**: Read entire paragraph first before attempting individual questions
